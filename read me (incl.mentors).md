task2.html is the actual game (game will be really slow due to slow speed , access it if u want to check collision , else go for the other)
in task2backup.html collision doesn't work as protagonist's speed = 20 , collision works only for speed = factors of 5
open this to navigate the maze a lot faster (also no collision)and also to check the way in which sound guides u to the key location

game is not yet complete

thank you
