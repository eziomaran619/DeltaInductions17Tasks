(1) if u want the player to move faster change speed in protagonist constructor, make sure it is less than 100
(2) if u want the key to be visible, change the visible property to true in doorKey constructor
(3) if u want to remove the dungeon like vision (fading view) change the visionRadius to false in protagonist constructor

game is not yet complete

thank you
